OMG dude, just finished watching Home Sweet Home: Rebirth and like, WHERE DO I EVEN START?! The whole thing was a rollercoaster, and, wow, did they really go ALL OUT with the plot twists. I’m kinda buzzing, but also totally drained, you know what I mean?

So first off, that opening scene... what even?! I was like screaming and laughing at the same time. Seriously, who writes this stuff? It’s just wild. The pacing was, ugh, a bit all over the place, like one minute you're chilling, next thing you know BAM, chaos everywhere. But hey, I kinda loved it, it kept me on my toes for sure. 

Oh, and that soundtrack. Bro, I swear they must’ve raided some DJ's playlist because it was BANGING. But like in the best way possible, kept me awake for sure. I didn’t even plan to watch the movie until you suggested it, so thanks for ruining my sleep schedule, haha. But legit, totally worth it, not even mad.

> And don’t even get me started on that character with the hat, like they were in another movie or something, lol. It's like the directors just went eh, why not and threw them in. You gotta admire that chaotic energy. Maybe next time I'll just download the movie instead, feels like there's stuff I need to watch again to actually believe it happened. 

At one point I thought Johnny was gonna become a zombie or whatever, and I was so ready for that but nooo, they decided to flip the script and make him the hero in the most absurd way. Not complaining, but come on. I mean, seriously?!?! 

Random line of C/C++: for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { std::cout << What even was that? << std::endl; }

Anyway, like, if you haven’t seen it yet, grab some popcorn and brace yourself, ‘cause this ride's insane. I'm gonna crash now, my brain's mushed to a pudding. Chat tomorrow?
